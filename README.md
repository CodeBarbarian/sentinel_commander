# Sentinel Commander

> ⚠️ **Early Alpha Notice**  
> Sentinel Commander is currently in early alpha. While many core features are functional and actively used, the platform is under continuous development. Expect rapid iteration, breaking changes, and new modules arriving frequently.

**Sentinel Commander** is a modular, open-source platform for cybersecurity alert triage, case management, and response orchestration. Built for modern Security Operations Centers (SOCs), it helps analysts investigate, document, and respond to threats with structure and flexibility.

## Top 5 Features

1. **Alert Ingestion via Webhooks**
   - Accept alerts from any external system (e.g., Wazuh) using unique GUID-based webhook endpoints with API key validation.
   
2. **YAML-Based Parsing Engine**
   - Dynamic field mapping and enrichment through editable YAML parser files. Enables structured alert triage, classification, and display customization.

3. **Full-Stack Case Management**
   - Create structured incidents with tabs for Summary, Notes, Tasks, IOCs, Timeline, Evidence, and connected alerts. Supports tagging, severity mapping, and closing workflows.

4. **Triage-Centric UI**
   - Fast, filterable alert views with bulk actions, tagging, and severity badges. Modals for resolution editing, triage workflows, and parser previews.

5. **Parser Sandbox** - (Currently disabled)
   - Upload and test YAML parsers directly in the UI. Validate enrichment logic before applying to production data.
